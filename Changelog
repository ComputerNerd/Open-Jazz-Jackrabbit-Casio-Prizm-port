hard-coded VRAM address for fx-CG50 compatibility.

1.04 Merged new commits from upstream.

1.03 Fixed screen corruption on real hardware as a result of a syscall drawing to the screen without waiting for DMA completion.

Note to exit you will have to use the exit button on the menu and press EXE to exit the credits.

1.00 Initial release.
