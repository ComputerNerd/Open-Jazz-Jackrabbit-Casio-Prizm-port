1.1 Urgent release: It fixes an issue where a file was left open. Due to a bug
with the calculator OS only one file that's not in root directory can be opened
at a time this meant prior to this release you had to reset your calculator
when trying to exit. This issue is documented on the Casio Prizm wiki:
https://prizm.cemetech.net/index.php?title=Bfile_OpenFile_OS

Also the planet sequence now shows and the specific level functionality is
disabled because it crashed the calculator upon trying to use it and also
because the text input feature is not currently implemented.

This release also merges a few fixes from upstream and also slightly reduces
heap usage.

In theory old versions could be risky to run so I urge you to upgrade to this
version or a newer version if one exists some time in the future.

1.05 No more need for openjazz.000. Getting a red gem in a level works.
Fonts now have the correct colors. Bonus stages work. No longer used a
hard-coded VRAM address for fx-CG50 compatibility.

1.04 Merged new commits from upstream.

1.03 Fixed screen corruption on real hardware as a result of a syscall drawing to the screen without waiting for DMA completion.

1.02 Fixed the HUD and reduced binary size. Also fixed a glitch where the program would not exit.
Note to exit you will have to use the exit button on the menu and press EXE to exit the credits.

1.01 Resolved an issue where fonts would not load on the Casio Prizm.

1.00 Initial release.
